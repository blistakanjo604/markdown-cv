## Tools I Use

TODO

### Usual Workflow

TODO

I use a **vim**-based setup in a tiling window manager (**awesomewm**). I compile documents using **R Markdown** or **LaTeX**, and **biber** for references.
I prefer multimedia manipulation in the terminal with tools like **imagemagick** and **ffmpeg** for extensibilitiy's sake.
I've run Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X and GNU/Linux systems (both Debian and Arch-based varieties, as well as Void Linux).

### Programs I'm familiar with.

tmux, ssh, RStudio, Blender (mostly for video-editing), Praat, Audacity, E-Prime, GIMP, pandoc, Jupyter. I've managed websites manually via ssh and vim using HTML/CSS/PHP and with tools such as Github Pages (Jekyll) WordPress via either cpanel or wp-cli. Some experience with myBB.
