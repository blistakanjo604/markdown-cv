Alongside Julian Raymond Yu from British School Manila, we held events that teaches children the fundamentals of Programming with tools such as Scratch, Lego Mindstorms, and Arduino. The children also experienced programming their own robot and competing in a miniature "sumo-bot" competition. A snippet of one of the events in Timoteo Paez Elementary School can be found on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/9rMGKcI5QoU).

+ International Robot High School Forum 2017 (2nd Speaker) | Japan
